    <h3>PPG Sensor Project</h3>
    <img src="images/img1/pj.jpg" alt="PPG Sensor Project">
    <p>
      This project involves the use of a Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor to measure heart rate and blood oxygen levels. 
      The PPG sensor detects changes in blood volume in the microvascular bed of tissue using light absorption. 
      An Arduino Uno microcontroller is used to process the data and display the results on an LCD screen. 
      The project demonstrates the integration of hardware and software to create a functional biomedical device. 
      It is designed to be portable and cost-effective, making it suitable for remote health monitoring. 
      The system is calibrated to ensure accurate readings and minimize noise interference. 
      Applications include fitness tracking, telemedicine, and early detection of cardiovascular issues. 
      The project also explores the potential for real-time data transmission via Bluetooth for remote monitoring. 
      This hands-on project highlights the importance of biomedical engineering in improving healthcare accessibility. 
      It serves as a foundation for developing more advanced wearable health monitoring systems.
